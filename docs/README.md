## Getting Started


Getting Started With Obullo 2.0
------
Any Any software application requires some effort to learn. We have done our best to minimize the learning curve while making the process as enjoyable as possible.The first step is to install Obullo, then read all the topics in the Introduction section of the Chapters.

Read General Topics
------
Next, read each of the General Topics pages in order. Each topic builds on the previous one, and includes code examples that you are encouraged to try.Once you understand the basics you'll be ready to explore the package reference pages to learn to utilize the packages and helper components.

## Installation Steps
------
Obullo is installed in five steps:

1. Unzip the package.
2. Upload the Obullo folders and files to your server. Normally the index.php file will be at your root.
3. Open the **app/config/config.php** file with a text editor and set your base URL. If you intend to use encryption or sessions, set your encryption key.
4. If you intend to use a database, Obullo use PDO for database operations. Mysql and SQLite drivers installed as default for PHP 5 and newer versions.
If you want use another Db driver you must enable your PDO Driver in your php.ini file.For more details look at Php.net http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php
5. Open the **app/config/database.php** file with a text editor and set your database settings.

If you wish to increase security by hiding the location of your Obullo files you can rename the base folder to something more private. If you do rename it, you must open your main index.php file and set the BASE constant in the page with the new name you've chosen.

That's it!

If you're new to Obullo, please read the [Getting Started](http://obullo.com/user_guide/en/1.0.1/getting-started.html) section of the Manual to begin learning how to build dynamic PHP applications.
