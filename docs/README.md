# Introduction


## Getting Started


### Getting Started With Obullo 2.0
-----
Any Any software application requires some effort to learn. We have done our best to minimize the learning curve while making the process as enjoyable as possible.The first step is to install Obullo, then read all the topics in the Introduction section of the Chapters.

### Read General Topics
------
Next, read each of the General Topics pages in order. Each topic builds on the previous one, and includes code examples that you are encouraged to try.Once you understand the basics you'll be ready to explore the package reference pages to learn to utilize the packages and helper components.

## Installation Steps

Obullo is installed in five steps:

1. Unzip the package.
2. Upload the Obullo folders and files to your server. Normally the index.php file will be at your root.
3. Open the **app/config/config.php** file with a text editor and set your base URL. If you intend to use encryption or sessions, set your encryption key.
4. If you intend to use a database, Obullo use PDO for database operations. Mysql and SQLite drivers installed as default for PHP 5 and newer versions.
If you want use another Db driver you must enable your PDO Driver in your php.ini file.For more details look at Php.net http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php
5. Open the **app/config/database.php** file with a text editor and set your database settings.

If you wish to increase security by hiding the location of your Obullo files you can rename the base folder to something more private. If you do rename it, you must open your main index.php file and set the BASE constant in the page with the new name you've chosen.

That's it!

If you're new to Obullo, please read the [Getting Started](http://obullo.com/user_guide/en/1.0.1/getting-started.html) section of the Manual to begin learning how to build dynamic PHP applications.

[We have a wiki page installation instructions for Ubuntu OS.](http://wiki.obullo.com/#setting_up_php_and_obullo_framework_under_the_ubuntu)



#General Features

## Summary of General Features


### Best Maintainability
------
If you have a development team and you want to easy maintenance and collaborative works Obullo right for you.

### Modular Programming ( Write your own modules )
------
Modular programming is, in essence, simply a programming technique and well realized in Obullo Framework. You can write your extensions and modules also Obullo support subfolders in modules directory.

### Obullo is a Free Application Framework
------
Obullo is a Php5 HMVC Framework licensed under an Apache/BSD-style open source license so you can use it however you please. For more information please read the license agreement.

### Good Debugging & Error Notifiers
------
Simple and effective debugging help identify and solve problems quickly.

### Obullo Generates Clean URLs and It works in Modules Mode as a Strict Rule
------
The URLs generated by Obullo are clean and search-engine friendly. Rather than using the standard "query string" approach to URLs that is synonymous with dynamic systems, Obullo uses a segment-based approach:
``` php
example.com/{module}/news/article/345
```
If a sub modules exists like a backend you can call without touching segments
``` php
example.com/{submodule}/{module}/news/article/345
```
Note: By default the **index.php** file is included in the URL but it can be removed using a simple .htaccess OR a nginx vhost file.

## Simple HMVC Library

Obullo has a simple HMVC library so you can write your own using extend it.

### Tasks - CLI and Ajax Support
------
Obullo has a integrated task functionality and Command Line Interface support who want to create command line tasks.

### NGINX Http Server Support
------
We tested the Obullo also on Nginx Servers, so you will do easy setup if you use Nginx.

### Validation in Model (Vmodel Class)
------
We use validation functions in model like ORM but not complex as ORM structure.

### Obullo Runs on PHP 5.1.2 and Newer
------
Obullo is written to be compatible with PHP 5. We focuses especially PHP5 Static Methods this subject very important in a PHP5 framework for the performance.
Take it advantage of new PHP5 functions, Enjoy it !

### Obullo is Light Weight
------
Extremely lightweight. The core system requires only a few very small libraries, Obullo use PDO extension for database operations. While you are using the Obullo you will understand well it why its light.

### Obullo is Thoroughly Documented
------
Programmers love to code and hate to write documentation. We're no different, of course, but since documentation is **as important** as the code itself, we are committed to doing it. Our source code is extremely clean and well commented as well.

#General Topics

## Obullo URLs
By default, URLs in Obullo are designed to be search-engine and human friendly. Rather than using the standard "query string" approach to URLs that is synonymous with dynamic systems, Obullo uses a segment-based approach:
``` php
example.com/{module}/news/article/my_article
```
**_Tip_**: Query string URLs can be optionally enabled, as described below.
### Sub Modules
------
If you have a sub module like 'sub.backend' first you need to call sub module name.
```php
example.com/{submodule}/{module}/news/article/my_article
```
### URI Segments
-----
The segments in the URL, in following with the Model-View-Controller approach, usually represent:
```php
example.com/module/class/method/ID
```
1. The first segment represents the **module** that should be invoked.
```php
$this->uri->segment(0);
```
2. The second segment represents the controller **class** that should be invoked.
```php
$this->uri->segment(1);
```
3. The third segment represents the class **method**, or function, that should be called.
```php
$this->uri->segment(2);
```
4. The fourth, and any additional segments, represent the ID and any variables that will be passed to the controller.
```php
$this->uri->segment(3);
```
The [URI Class](http://obullo.com/user_guide/en/1.0.1/uri-class.html) and the [URL Helper](http://obullo.com/user_guide/en/1.0.1/url-helper.html) contain functions that make it easy to work with your URI data. In addition, your URLs can be remapped using the [URI Routing](http://obullo.com/user_guide/en/1.0.1/uri-routing.html) feature for more flexibility.

If you have a **Sub Module** you can fetch sub module using $this->uri->segment('sub'), if submodule not found function returns to FALSE.
```php
$this->uri->segment('sub');
```
### Removing the index.php file
------
By default, the **index.php** file will be included in your URLs:
```php
example.com/index.php/module/news/article/my_article
```
### Apache HTTP Server
------
If you use Apache HTTP Server you can easily remove this file by using a **.htaccess** file with some simple rules. Here is an example of such a file, using the **"negative"** method in which everything is redirected except the specified items:
```php
DirectoryIndex index.php
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule (.*)/public/(.*) modules/$1/public/$2 [L]
RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|obullo|modules|application|public)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ ./index.php/$1 [L,QSA]
```
In the above example, any HTTP request other than those for index.php, **/public** folder, and **robots.txt** is treated as a request for your index.php file.

**RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d**
If the request is for a real directory (one that exists on the server), index.php isn't served.

**RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f**
If the request is for a file that exists already on the server, index.php isn't served.

**RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php**
All other requests are sent to index.php.

### Nginx HTTP Server
------
Removing index.php file also easy in Nginx, add below the codes to your vhost file like this. Change the all **"/var/www/obullo.com/public"** texts as your web server root path.
```php
server {
        limit_conn   myzone  10;
        listen       80;
        server_name  obullo.com www.obullo.com;

        #charset utf-8;

        access_log  /var/www/obullo.com/log/host.access.log  main;
        error_log   /var/www/obullo.com/log/host.error.log;

        root   /var/www/obullo.com/public;
        index  index.php index.html index.htm;

        # START OBULLO FRAMEWORK REWRITE RULES
        # ( Obullo URI_PROTOCOL should be REQUEST_URI
        # / application /config / uri_protocol = REQUEST_URI )

        # enforce NO www
        if ($host ~* ^www\.(.*))
        {
                set $host_without_www $1;
                rewrite ^/(.*)$ $scheme://$host_without_www/$1 permanent;
        }

        # canonicalize Obullo url end points
        # if your default controller is something other than "welcome" you should change the following
        if ($request_uri ~* ^(/welcome(/index)?|/index(.php)?)/?$)
        {
                rewrite ^(.*)$ / permanent;
        }

        # removes trailing "index" from all controllers
        if ($request_uri ~* index/?$)
        {
                rewrite ^/(.*)/index/?$ /$1 permanent;
        }

        # removes trailing slashes (prevents SEO duplicate content issues)
        if (!-d $request_filename)
        {
                rewrite ^/(.+)/$ /$1 permanent;
        }

        # removes access to "obullo" folder, also allows a "System.php" controller
        if ($request_uri ~* ^/obullo)
        {
                rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 last;
                break;
        }

        # unless the request is for a valid file (image, js, css, etc.), send to bootstrap
        if (!-e $request_filename)
        {
                rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 last;
                break;
        }

        # END OBULLO FRAMEWORK REWRITE RULES

        # error_page  404              /404.html;
        # location = /404.html {
        #   root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        # }

        # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
        #
        # error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        # location = /50x.html {
        #    root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        # }

        # proxy the PHP scripts to Apache listening on 127.0.0.1:80
        #
        #location ~ \.php$ {
        #    proxy_pass   http://127.0.0.1;
        #}

        # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000

        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
            fastcgi_index  index.php;
            fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/obullo.com/public/$fastcgi_script_name;
            include        fastcgi_params;
        }

        # deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root
        # concurs with nginx's one
        #
        location ~ /\.ht {
            deny  all;
        }
    }
```
**Edit your config.php**

Finally you should do some changes in your **application/config/config.php** file.
```php
$config['index_page'] = "";
$config['uri_protocol'] = "REQUEST_URI";   // QUERY_STRING
```
If you can't get uri requests try to change your uri protocol which is defined **application/config/config.php** file.

### Adding a URL Suffix
------
In your **config/config.php** file you can specify a suffix that will be added to all URLs generated by Obullo. For example, if a URL is this:
```php
example.com/index.php/shop/products/view/shoes
```
You can optionally add a suffix, like **.html**, making the page appear to be of a certain type:
```php
example.com/index.php/shop/products/view/shoes.html
```
### Enabling Query Strings
------
In some cases you might prefer to use query strings URLs:
```php
index.php?d=shop&c=products&m=view&id=345
```
Obullo optionally supports this capability, which can be enabled in your application/config.php file. If you open your config file you'll see these items:
```php
$config['enable_query_strings'] = FALSE;
$config['directory_trigger']  = 'd';
$config['controller_trigger'] = 'c';
$config['function_trigger'] = 'm';
```
If you change "enable_query_strings" to TRUE this feature will become active. Your controllers and functions will then be accessible using the "trigger" words you've set to invoke your directory, controllers and methods:
```php
index.php?d=directory&c=controller&m=method
```
**_Please note:_** If you are using query strings you will have to build your own URLs, rather than utilizing the URL helpers (and other helpers that generate URLs, like some of the form helpers) as these are designed to work with segment based URLs.
### URI Extensions
-------
You can use uri extensions when you use ajax, xml, rss, json.. requests, you can dynamically change the application behaviours using uri extensions. Also this functionality will help you to create friendly urls.
```php
example.com/module/class/post.json
```
You can define allowed extensions from your application/config/config.php file, default allowed URI extensions listed below.
- php
- html
- json
- xml
- raw
- rss
- ajax

Using URI Class $this->uri->extension(); function you can grab the called URI extension.
```php
switch($this->uri->extension())
{
    case 'json':
        echo json_encode($data);
    break;
    
    case 'html':
        echo $data;
    break;
}
```
