	|  Write Concerns:
	|   w=0         Unacknowledged	A write will not be followed up with a GLE call, and therefore not checked ("fire and forget")
	|   w=1         Acknowledged	The write will be acknowledged by the server (the primary on replica set configuration)
	|   w=N         Replica Set Acknowledged	The write will be acknowledged by the primary server, and replicated to N-1 secondaries.
	|   w=majority	Majority Acknowledged	The write will be acknowledged by the majority of the replica set (including the primary). This is a special reserved string.
	|   w=<tag set>	Replica Set Tag Set Acknowledged	The write will be acknowledged by members of the entire tag set
	|   j=true	Journaled	The write will be acknowledged by primary and the journal flushed to disk
